1. Create a git repo and clone it in your local system.
2. Create code.py and add code to it. (it will save a csv file to a new "data" folder)
3. Do a git add-commit push before initializing dvc.
4. Install dvc using pip.
5. Now we do "dvc init" (creates .dvcignore, .dvc)
6. Now create a dir - s3.
7. Now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote s3_uri"
8. Next "dvc add data/"
   Now it will ask to do: ("git rm -r --cached 'data'" and "git commit -m "stop tracking data"")
   Because initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for dvc to handle.
9. Again we do "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
10. Now - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
11. Do a git add-commit-push to mark this stage as first version of data
12. Now make changes to mycode.py to append a new role in data, check changes via "dvc status"
13. Again - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
14. Then git add-commit-push (we are saving v2 of our data at this point)
15. Check dvc/git status, everything should be upto date.
16. Repeat step: 12-14 for v3 of data
